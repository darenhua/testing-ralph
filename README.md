# Trying out RALPH WIGGUM CODING
This is a test repo that helps me get the hang of how I use claude code for true vibes ralph wiggum type code.

There are intricacies to ralph wiggum coding that I just don't get yet, but I'll understand with time. As of what I understand so far, the core of ralph is running claude code in an infinite while loop with the same prompt -- but in that prompt, you ask claude to plan next steps using spec and todo list files in the file system which lets the same prompt do different actions each time.

The first step that I must implement is REQUIREMENTS. The output is a specs folder full of context for initializing every agent that might need information about what im building and how i should build it.

The second step is TODO LIST. The output is an IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md,
