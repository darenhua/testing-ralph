# File Upload Screen Implementation Summary

## What was implemented:

### 1. File Upload Component (`/components/file-upload.tsx`)
- Created a fully functional drag-and-drop file upload component using React Dropzone
- Accepts only .tex files as specified
- Large dropzone area with "Upload your math homework" text
- Shows "Accepted file types: .tex" description
- Interactive feedback states:
  - Default state with upload icon
  - Drag active state (blue highlight)
  - Invalid file type state (red warning)
  - Processing state with spinner and file info
- Displays file name and size during processing
- Error handling for failed uploads

### 2. TypeScript Types (`/types/file-upload.ts`)
- Created proper TypeScript interfaces:
  - `UploadedFile`: Interface for uploaded file data
  - `FileUploadResponse`: Interface for backend response

### 3. File Context (`/contexts/file-context.tsx`)
- Created React Context for global file ID management
- Provides `useFile` hook for accessing file ID throughout the app
- Persists file ID across components

### 4. Updated Main Page (`/app/page.tsx`)
- Implemented conditional rendering:
  - Shows FileUpload component when no file is uploaded
  - Shows Assistant (chat) component after successful upload
- Uses the file context for state management

### 5. Updated Layout (`/app/layout.tsx`)
- Wrapped app with FileProvider for context access
- Updated metadata for the math homework assistant

## Features:

1. **Drag and Drop**: Full drag-and-drop functionality with visual feedback
2. **File Validation**: Only accepts .tex files
3. **Visual States**: 
   - Idle state with instructions
   - Hover/drag state with blue highlight
   - Invalid file rejection with red warning
   - Processing state with spinner and file details
4. **Professional Styling**: Centered layout with Tailwind CSS
5. **Error Handling**: Shows error messages for failed uploads

## Current State:

- The upload functionality currently simulates a backend response with a 2-second delay
- Generates a mock file ID that's passed to the chat interface
- The actual backend integration is marked with TODO comments and ready to be implemented

## Next Steps:

When ready to implement the backend:
1. Replace the simulated upload in the `onDrop` callback with an actual API call
2. The backend should create the folder structure as specified in the requirements
3. Return the actual file ID from the backend

The implementation is fully functional on the frontend and ready for backend integration.
