# Agent Work Plan

## Current Task: Priority 2 - File Upload Screen

Based on the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, Priority 1 is complete and we're now working on Priority 2.

### Priority 2 Tasks to Implement:
1. [ ] Implement React Dropzone component
   - [ ] Create drag-and-drop UI with proper messaging
   - [ ] Add file type validation (.tex only)
   - [ ] Add upload state handling and visual feedback
2. [ ] Create backend storage system
   - [ ] Implement file upload endpoint
   - [ ] Create random ID generation for files
   - [ ] Set up storage directory structure (/storage/{random_id})
   - [ ] Implement file cloning (file_clone.tex)
3. [ ] Add React context for file ID storage
4. [ ] Implement conditional rendering between upload and chat screens

## Implementation Strategy:
I will use up to 3 subagents to implement these features:
1. **Subagent 1**: Implement the React Dropzone component and frontend UI
2. **Subagent 2**: Create the backend storage system and API endpoints
3. **Subagent 3**: Integrate the frontend and backend, add React context, and implement screen transitions

## Notes:
- The project already has react-dropzone installed as a dependency
- The current app is a chat interface that needs to be enhanced with file upload as the initial screen
- We need to maintain the existing assistant-ui integration while adding the new features
