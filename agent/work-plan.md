# Agent Work Plan

## Current Task: Priority 1 - Project Setup and Infrastructure

Based on the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, the project setup is partially complete but needs finalization:

### Already Completed:
- ✅ Next.js project initialized with app router
- ✅ TypeScript configured
- ✅ Project directory structure created
- ✅ assistant-ui library integrated

### To Complete:
1. [ ] Set up ESLint configuration (appears to be missing or incomplete)
2. [ ] Configure required dependencies for the math homework assistant features

## Analysis:
Looking at the current implementation, the project has been set up as a general chat assistant using assistant-ui. However, it needs to be adapted for the specific math homework use case with:
- File upload capabilities
- LaTeX rendering and preview
- PDF generation
- Backend storage system

The highest priority item that needs implementation is completing the ESLint setup to ensure code quality standards are met for future development.
