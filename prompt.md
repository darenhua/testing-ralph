0a. read everything in specs/
0b. review the files in src/

1. pick the SINGLE highest priority item from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and implement it using up to 3 subagents.
    - you are responsible for writing automated tests for any business logic if an item asks for it, but you do not need to write tests for frontend updates.
    - do NOT make code changes or do research yourself, you must spin up at least one subagent to implement a change.
    - terminate the subagents when the item is complete.
    - You MUST use the agent/ directory as a scratchpad for your work to store long term plans and todo lists there.
2. ensure the tests and checks are passing using ONLY ONE subagent.
3. once tests pass, update the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with your progress and commit all changes with git add -A && git commit -m "..."

if there is a discrepancy in the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and the spec, always update the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to match the spec.
